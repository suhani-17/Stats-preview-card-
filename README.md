### What I learned

Through this challenge I learned how to position elements using flexbox. also, how to use overlay color effect on the image that was what i found difficult as i was looking through filter property but couldn't find the solution.

### Continued development

this challenge is the first one where i used flexbox so this concept is rather new to me and i want to refine it so that i can position elements with flexbox properly.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me apply various css design property like border-radius. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [apna college youtube channel](https://youtu.be/zts6uNVnCNs) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to position elements using flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
